# News Summary challenge

## Set up
$ `npm install --save guardian-js`

## Project overview

This app grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and display them on a page.  Clicking on a headline shows a summary of the article.

### Technologies

- A single page web app.  Code is in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
- No libraries of frameworks. Not even testing framework - I wrote that.

### Serving your app

You'll use a static web server (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.  You'll send requests to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.

> The API is hosted on an external server that you don't have to worry about.  You only need a static web server.  That's why this type of architecture is called "serverless".

### Guardian API 

The basic idea is to send an `apiRequestUrl` query parameter to the News Summary API.  The value of this parameter is the URL of the request you *would* have made to the Guardian or Aylien API, minus any API credentials.

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```
curl "http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body&api-key=SECRET_API_KEY"
```

To make this request via the Makers News Summary API with cURL, you could do something like this:

```
curl "http://news-summary-api.herokuapp.com/guardian?apiRequestUrl=http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2014/feb/17/alex-salmond-speech-first-minister-scottish-independence-eu-currency-live?show-fields=body"
```

Note how the `apiRequestUrl` parameter value is just the request you would have made to the Guardian API, minus `api-key`.
